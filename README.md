## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This documentation details the implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in a sample web application using Python and Flask. 2FA enhances account security by requiring users to provide a second form of identification in addition to their password.

## Importance of Two-Factor Authentication
Two-Factor Authentication adds an additional layer of security to user accounts by requiring both a password and a second factor, such as a generated token. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized account access through compromised passwords.

## Benefits:
**Increased Security:** Provides additional protection against unauthorized access.
**Protection Against Phishing:** Secures user accounts, even if passwords are stolen.
**Reduction of Account Takeover:** Lowers the chance of account hijacking.
**User Awareness and Trust:** Increases user confidence in application security.
**Compliance with Regulations:** Meets security requirements in various industries.

## Prerequisites
**Python 3.x:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.

**Flask:** A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python.

**Libraries:** We'll be using pyotp (for generating TOTP tokens) and qrcode (for generating QR codes).

## Environment Setup
**1. Create a New Directory:**
